# codekitty library

## Guidelines 

- To add features, create a feature branch then pull request to merge with master
- Master branch corresponds to whatever the most current kitty is using
- Maintain a branch for each other board
- Create releases for each board until we no longer support a board
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- No versioning in master
